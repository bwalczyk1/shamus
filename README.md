# Shamus
Functioning web version of a Commodore64 game named Shamus made using Typescript and Webpack. You can play it on [my website](http://bwalczyk.ct8.pl/shamus) and because of the enemies it's pretty hard, so I'll be impressed if you make it through more than 10 rooms. Just remember, there are 128 of them in total ðŸ˜‰.
